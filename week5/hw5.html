  Class 5 - Feb 16, 2006

    Homework 5 (due by end of next class period)

    Registration page

    1) (10 pts) - Modify the registration page and appropriate functions to do
    the following:

     * If  the  registration  is good (ie all the form fields are valid),
       add  the  information into a file called "users.txt". Seperate all
       the fields with a colon (:). Example:
       username:firstName:lastName:address:city:state:zip.  Make sure you
       have  enough  fields  for all your form elements, but do not store
       the  password  in  this  file.  Also, add a field for checking the
       users status.
     * If  the  registration  is good, add the username and password to a
       file  called  "login.txt".  The format of the file is in part 2 of
       this  assignment. Make sure you set the last_date_logged_in to the
       current  time,  and  in  the  date format listed in part 3 of this
       assignment.
     * Make  sure  both the "users.txt" and "login.txt" files are in your
       home directory and not your public_html directory.

    2) (5 pts) - Verify users

   From  last week's homework, modify the login script to check against a
   text  file  which  contains  the  user names and passwords of everyone
   registered  on  the  system.  All entries in the file should be in the
   following format:
username:password:last_date_logged_in

    3) (5 pts) - Update log in information

   Update  your  login script and the appropriate functions to update the
   "last_date_logged_in" field in the login file (above). The last logged
   in date should be in the following format:
02-22-2004_0710PM

    4) (10 pts) - Upload Page

   Create  a page that allows the user (if logged in) to upload images to
   the web site. The uploaded files must conform to the following:
     * Must be .jpg, .gif, or .png
     * Must be less than 100KB
     * Cannot have more than 50 total images uploaded on the server

   Each  user  must  have their own directory to upload the images and it
   must  be  a  sub-directory  off  your  public_html directory. I.e user
   "johnDoe"  should  have a directory /home/YOURUSERNAME/public_html/johnDoe/
   where his images are uploaded and stored

   Create  a page for the user to view all of their uploaded images. This
   page   must   be   accessible   by   using  the  following  URL  type:
   http://morticia.hennepintech.edu/~YOURUSERNAME/userName/showImages.php      ,
   where  uXXXXXX  is your user name and userName is the user's username.
   This page must contain the following:
     * Total number of images uploaded by that user
     * Total space used on the server
     * A  table  listing  every image, it's size, and name hyperlinked to
       that  image.  Example:  User  johnDoe  uploads an image file named
       "myFile.jpg"  which  is  57  KB and another file named "myDog.gif"
       which  is  33 KB. The table should have 2 entries similar to below
       and  a summary showing 2 images uploaded with a total file size of
       90KB

TOTAL IMAGES: 2
TOTAL SPACE ON SERVER: 90KB

IMAGES:
+----------------------------+-------------------+
|Image Name                  |File size          |
+----------------------------+-------------------+
|myFile.jpg                  |57 KB              |
+----------------------------+-------------------+
|myDog.gif                   |33 KB              |
+----------------------------+-------------------+

    Extra Credit (2 pts)

   Make  a page (or modify the upload page) to allow the user to edit any
   images  they  have on the server. This includes the following (partial
   credit will be given):
     * Ability to rename the file (1pts)
     * Ability to delete the file (1pts)

    Extra credit(1 pt)

   Modify  the  upload page to check and see if a file with the same name
   has  already been uploaded. If it has, notify the user and prompt them
   to  rename the old file, or verify they want to overwrite the existing
   file. If they want to overwrite, allow the script to do so (default).

    All your HTML code must be 508 compliant and XHTML1.0 Strict or better and
    all your PHP code must be well commented and formatted.

    Upload the files to the server and email a link to your homework, as well
    as a zipped / tarred file containing all your homework to
    phpclass@linux-classes.com - YOU MUST EMAIL THE ZIP / TAR FILE, AND A LINK TO YOUR
    HOMEWORK TO RECEIVE CREDIT
